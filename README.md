WATER CRISIS-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD 



This project investigates water availability and source quality across rural and urban provinces, alongside queue patterns, pollution levels, and crime trends. Using Power BI dashboards, it visualizes town- and province-level data, highlighting gender dynamics in water access. The analysis uncovers patterns in water distribution, queue times, and associated security issues. The goal is to uncover patterns and provide insights that can support better planning and water infrastructure decision-making,  improve water accessibility, and reduce related risks.

PROBLEM STATEMENT


Access to clean, reliable water remains a critical challenge in many regions. In Maji Ndogo, disparities between rural and urban areas, long queues, pollution risks, and gender-based vulnerabilities affect daily life and safety.
